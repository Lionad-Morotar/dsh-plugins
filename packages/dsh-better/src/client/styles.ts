 * The stylesheet for the two things the shell has no styling for: effort badges

 * Everything else on these surfaces reuses the shell's own hashed classes, so it
 * follows the host's theme for free. Effort badges have no counterpart there, and
 * neither does a selected attachment — the shipped rail has no selection state at
 * all. Both are styled here, entirely from the shell's design tokens rather than
 * literal colors: that is what keeps them legible in both color schemes, and what
 * keeps them looking like part of the menu instead of pasted onto it.

   the shell keeps its markup, radius and hover states, and an outline reflows
   nothing when the mark appears or disappears.

   Inset, not around: the rail's track is overflow-x auto / overflow-y hidden and
   exactly as tall as its items, so anything painted outside an item is clipped
   away on the top and bottom edges and the mark reads as broken. Drawing inside
   keeps all four edges, and the element's own border radius keeps the ring
   concentric with the shape it belongs to.

   The mark is on the inner element rather than the rail item wrapper because a
   file card paints an opaque background over the wrapper's box: an inset ring on
   the wrapper is drawn underneath the card and never appears.

   The accent is state-business-primary because that is the token this theme
   actually populates with the product accent — it is the send button's own fill.
   brand-primary reads like the accent by name but resolves to the ink colour
   here, which would draw a black ring. */
